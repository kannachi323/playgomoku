boredgamz is a scalable, real-time web platform that hosts classic multiplayer games such as Gomoku, Chess, Poker, Connect Four, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Mahjong. The project features a custom networking engine capable of managing lobbies, matchmaking queues, and multi-user game rooms with low-latency state synchronization.

On the frontend, boredgamz uses modern UI patterns to deliver responsive, intuitive game interfaces, while the backend focuses on reliability, concurrency, and extensibility. New games can be added easily through a modular architecture that cleanly separates core engine logic from individual game implementations.
